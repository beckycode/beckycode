- 👋 Hi, I’m @beckycode, a Frontend developer with experience in web development.
<br/>
  Since I started my career, I've developed different websites, and systems in different programming languages.
  I have also experienced different roles such as Back-end developer, mobile developer, and my current role which is Front-end developer.
  I decided to focus on Front-end development because in this area I can work closely with the design team, and improve UI and UX experience for the programs and systems that I work on. In that way, I feel more satisfy to deliver a product with quality and a friendly user experience.
<br/>
   My current stack is based in these technologies: Vue.js, TypeScript, CSS - Sass and Vitest - Vue utils (unit testing). 

<br/>
<br/>
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about testing, specially Playwright to improve the testing of my code and support the quality of the products and the operations of the company
<br/>
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my knowledge in Typescript combined with Vue.js
<br/>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code communities
<br/>
- 📫 You can reach me by email: hi.beckycode@gmail.com
